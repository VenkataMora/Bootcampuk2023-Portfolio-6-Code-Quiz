# Web APIs: Code Quiz

## Description
Welcome to the Code Quiz! This interactive Quiz is designed with dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It features a series of multiple-choice questions, and the time remaining is automatically tracked. 

The game begins with a start button, which, when clicked, will start the timer and display the first question. After answering a question, the next question will appear automatically. If an incorrect answer is selected, time will be subtracted from the timer.

When all questions have been answered or the timer reaches 0, the game will end, and the player will be presented with their final score. The player will also have the opportunity to save their score and initials by typing them into a designated input field.
